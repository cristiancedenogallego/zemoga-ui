This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Considerations

1. To start project please run
`yarn start`

2. This project dont include any css framework because in the project requirements not included any old browser this make a valid opcion use css grid, but i generally use foundation or bootstrap when i need give support to old browsers.

3. This project dont use any kind of css preprocessor because i used [styled-components] package that use tagged template literals to style components with the next beneficts.

. SASS Like syntax supported.
. Adapting component styles based on props.
. Use all JS power to style components.
. With react native web we can share some components with the react native team in case this exists.
. Autoprefixer included.

4. I use the eslint airbnb for ensure javascript minimum code quality https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb

5. I use flow as type checker

6. All images are ontimized JPEG and ready for progressive loading
